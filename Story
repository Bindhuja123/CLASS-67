***Story***
Once upon a time, in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamoon tree, which was on the banks of the river.
In the same forest there lived a Crocodile and his wife.
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the tree. 
The kindhearted monkey offerd him some fruits. 
The crocodile came back the next day for more fruits, as he loved them.
As days passes by the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
